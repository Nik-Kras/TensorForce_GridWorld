# TensorForce_GridWorld
Applying TensorForse framework to create an RL agent in my GridWorld game

Instruction to make TensorForce work:

1. Create a project with `Python version=3.8` (i.e. using Conda)
2. Clone original TensorForce repo `git clone https://github.com/tensorforce/tensorforce.git`
3. Install it `pip install -e tensorforce`
4. Downgrade gym to `gym version=0.21`
    1. Download gym release version 0.21
    2. Put in the project's folder and install `pip install -e gym-0.21.0 `
